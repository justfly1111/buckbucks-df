The original size of these cursors is 20x20 pixels. This may be too small for
some, so a 24x24 pixel set is added to the package. Note that the process of
scaling to 24 pixels causes the sharp edges to blur somewhat.

## Installation instructions
* Extract the .tar.gz folder that you downloaded
* Descend into the extracted folder
* Move either the `pixelfun2`, `pixelfun2-24px`, or both directories into your user's icons directory (typically `~/.icons/`).

## Generating the cursors
Dependencies:

* `convert` and `identify` commands (imagemagick/graphicsmagick)
* `Python 3`
* `xcursorgen`

This repo contains the necessary bits to generate/create the icon theme. Just
invoke `mkcursors.py`.

## Submitting issues
The project is hosted on [https://git.sr.ht/~ainola/pixelfun2](sh.rt). Report
issues on the accompanying [todo tracker](https://todo.sr.ht/%7Eainola/pixelfun2).
